All colours are prefixed with "AColour". The 'A' at the start is just for quick searching.
All brushes are prefixed with "ABrush", the 'A' used for the same reason as colours.

Foreground has a static, deeper and disabled colour.
    Static for regular text colour
    Deeper is just a slightly darker/less visible colour
    Disabled is a much darker/less visible colour

Glyphs have static, disabled, mouse over/down, selected + inactive selected colours.
There's also a colourful glyph which has the same keys but with "Colourful" added



Tones


Tones are the different colour phases for different controls. The lower tone number
means darker (in dark themes) and typically lighter in light themes

Accent tones follow the same rules but they use a colour instead of
moving towards black or white (for dark/light themes)

Tone 0, 1, 2 and 3 are useful for containers/panels (e.g. Grid or a Border that
contains a Grid, DockPanels, etc.)

The rest of the tones are used for standard controls (e.g. buttons). Most controls
use Tone 4 and 5, but some may use higher tones. You can obviously changes this
if you want and make a button use a higher tone in order to stand out more

All Color keys have a corresponding SolidColourBrush key
(e.g. "AColour.Glyph.Static" -> "ABrush.Glyph.Static"), which is useful
if you want to animate a colour which I think requires Colour not Brush
(that might be gradients though, can't remember)
